c. What have I done in this assignment:
	I have finished all the sockets part as described in the Project requirement. But the prefix function sometimes doesn't work well.


d. what each file does:
	client.c: read function name and input word;
	          set TCP connection to aws server;
	          receive result from aws and show results. 
	
	aws.c: set TCP with client, get the input;
	 		set 3 UDP with back end server A, B, C, send the query input;
	 		received the result from A, B, C;
	 		send the final result to client;
	 		set TCP with monitor;
	 		send final result to monitor.
	
	serverA.c: read the backend file. implement a list to store the words and definations;
				set UDP with aws; get query;
				do the search form the list, send results back to aws.
	serverB.c: same as A
	serverC.c: same as A

	monitor.c: set TCP with aws; receive the data from aws.

	list.c: a help data structure to store the dictionary data.
	list.h: header file of list.c

e. The format of all the messages exchanged:
   the format most aer same as the document said except for the prefix part.

f. the idiosyncrasy:
	
	The monitor must start before starting the client.

	The prefix doesn't work well if there's a large result. If the prefix function goes wrong, the monitor and aws need to restart. 



g. reuse of the code:
	Some code block for setting TCP and UDP are from "Beej's Guide to Network Programming -- Using Internet Sockets". 
	They are marked in the program. 
    Some part of list.c file is from my last semester CS402's homework's code. But I changed most of it.
